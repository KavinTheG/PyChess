# PyChess
This project is a chess game developped with python using the pygame library. I created this project with the intentions to hone my coding skills and challenge myself with a difficult project. Game still requires testing to hammer out any bugs. 

## Prerequisites
 - Python 3.x
 - Pygame (and its dependencies)
